## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**

In today's interconnected world, collaboration is vital for success in various fields, including research and project management. However, traditional collaboration platforms often face challenges related to security, privacy, and centralization. The Decentralized Secure Collaboration Platform (DSCP) addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques to provide a secure and transparent environment for collaborative work.

### **1.2 Problem Statement**

Existing collaboration platforms often rely on centralized servers, making them vulnerable to security breaches and unauthorized access. Additionally, users may have limited control over their data and identities, raising concerns about privacy and data ownership. DSCP aims to overcome these limitations by decentralizing identity management, implementing end-to-end encryption for file sharing, and providing robust access control mechanisms.

### **1.3 Objectives**

- Develop a decentralized platform for secure collaboration in research and project management.
- Implement decentralized identity management to enhance privacy and data ownership.
- Utilize cryptographic techniques for secure file sharing and communication.
- Enable role-based access control to ensure fine-grained permissions for users.
- Provide transparency and accountability through an audit trail of platform activities.

### **1.4 Scope**

DSCP will focus on providing a comprehensive solution for collaborative research and project management. The platform will support features such as decentralized identity creation, secure file sharing, two-factor authentication, role-based access control, audit trail, and smart contracts for milestone agreements. The initial version of DSCP will target academic researchers, project teams, and professionals involved in collaborative work.

## **2. Use Case: Collaborative Research and Project Management**

### **2.1 Use Case Overview**

DSCP will be used by research teams, academic institutions, and project managers to collaborate on research projects, manage project milestones, and securely share project-related files and data. Users can create decentralized identities, join collaborative projects, securely share files, communicate with team members, and track project milestones using smart contracts.

### **2.2 Target Audience**

- Academic researchers and research teams collaborating on academic papers and research projects.
- Project managers and professionals involved in project management across various industries.
- Individuals and organizations requiring a secure and transparent platform for collaboration and file sharing.

### **2.3 Significance**

DSCP addresses the growing need for secure and transparent collaboration platforms in today's digital landscape. By leveraging blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques, DSCP ensures privacy, security, and accountability for users engaged in collaborative work. The platform's decentralized nature enhances data ownership and control, mitigates single points of failure, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
